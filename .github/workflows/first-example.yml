# The `on` section defines the events that trigger the workflow.
on:
  # This workflow runs when code is pushed to the "main" branch
  push:
    branches: [ "main" ]

  # This workflow also runs when a pull request targets the "main" branch
  pull_request:
    branches: [ "main" ]

  # This allows users to manually trigger the workflow via the GitHub UI (Actions tab)

# Workflow Jobs Section
# --------------------------------------------

# `jobs` defines one or more tasks that will be executed.
# Each job runs independently by default, unless specified.
jobs:
  # Defining a job named "build"
  build:
    # `runs-on` specifies the type of runner (i.e., virtual machine) to execute this job.
    # "ubuntu-latest" means it will use the latest stable Ubuntu runner provided by GitHub.
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest

    # Each job consists of a list of `steps`
    # Steps are executed sequentially within the job
    steps:
      # Step 1: Checkout the repository code
      # This uses the official GitHub Action to check out your source code into the runner
      - name: Welcome message
        run: echo "My first github workflow"

      # Step 2: Run a simple one-line shell script
      - name: List files
        run: ls

      # Step 3: Run a block of multi-line shell commands
      # Useful for running multiple setup or test commands in sequence
      - name: Read file
        run: cat READMEME.MD
