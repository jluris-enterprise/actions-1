# GitHub Actions Workflow Example
# ==============================

name: Workflow Filters and Activities

on:
  workflow_dispatch:   # Allows manually running the workflow from the Actions tab

  # schedule:          # (Optional) Uncomment if you want to schedule this workflow
  #   - cron: "*/59 * * * *"  # Example: run every 59 minutes (disabled here)

  push:
    branches:
      - main
      - '!feature/*'  # (⚠️ Not valid syntax in GitHub Actions) Intended to ignore branches starting with "feature/"
    # branches-ignore:   # (Alternative way, safer than above)
    #   - feature/*      # Ignore all branches starting with "feature"
    #   - test/**        # Ignore nested test branches like test/ui/index

  pull_request:
    types:
      - opened   # Trigger when PR is opened
      - closed   # Trigger when PR is closed
    paths-ignore:   # Ignore workflow runs if changes are only in specific files
      - README.md   # Skip workflow when PR changes only README.md
    branches:       # Restrict PRs that target certain branches
      - main        # Only PRs targeting main branch will trigger workflow

jobs:
  hello:   # Job name (can be anything)
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest   # The virtual environment used (latest Ubuntu runner)

    steps:   # Steps executed inside the job
      - run: echo "this workflow/job/step is executed for event type - ${{ github.event_name }}"
        # This step prints the event type that triggered the workflow
        # (e.g., "push", "pull_request", or "workflow_dispatch")
